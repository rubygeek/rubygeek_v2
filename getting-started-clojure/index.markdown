Here's a list of the resources that have helped me and things I am currently doing to learn Clojure. I'll update this periodically when I find something interesting or useful.


### Editors

The best place for beginners to start is to use [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/) and [start the insta-repl](http://docs.lighttable.com/). It is so nice! If you are into using IDEs, then [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/) is a great tool. Here's a [setup for vim](http://www.zeespencer.com/the-vim-lovers-guide-to-editing-clojure/). Alot of people (including myself) use Emacs but it is by no means required for Clojure. If your fingers are muscle memoried to vim, try [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/). Whatever editor you use, the most important thing is figure out how to slurp and barf in your editor :) Paredit is your friend. 


### Koans

When getting started with any new language I look to see if they have any koans, after learning about [RubyKoans](http://www.rubykoans.com) and having so much fun doing them in Ruby I discovered it is a great way to tackle any new language. In fact, I have indexed all the [Koans](http://blog.rubygeek.com/2011/01/22/koan-a-copia/) I can find for all the languages. When I decided to learn Clojure, I looked at my list and found the [ClojureKoans](http://www.clojurekoans.com). If you get stuck, there is a [video walk through](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1p6TgkbKXqyOwq6iSkce_EY5YWFHciHt) that I've used (plus its a great way to see lighttable in action).

### Books

[Clojure for the Brave and True](http://amzn.to/2DgWYzi) - a great resource, read it [online for free](http://www.braveclojure.com/) or buy the ebook version. I started with reading it online, and I liked it and supported the author by buying a copy. It has a great Emacs introduction too and I use that as my base setup for Emacs.

[Living Clojure](http://amzn.to/2BGS3rc) - A great start into learning Clojure. After you get an introduction to the language, you can follow small assignments for practicing Clojure.

[Clojure Cookbook](http://amzn.to/2DhXi0N) - In true O'Reilly Cookbook form, a collection of small bits of code targeted to tasks. Great when you know what you want to do but don't know how to do it in Clojure.

[Clojure Programming](http://amzn.to/2C8oYGf) by Chas Emerick, Brian Carper, and Christophe Grand - It is a great book and unlike any I have read because it sometimes gives examples in Python/Ruby to explain the Clojure.

[Clojure Applied](http://amzn.to/2DhDc6S) - This is great when you learn the basics, and then you want to know how to write your application in Clojure. After it came out, I wrote a detailed [review](http://blog.clojuregeek.com/2015/08/30/book-review-clojure-applied/). It's just awesome to see the application of Clojure.


### Podcasts

* [Defn](https://defn.audio/) - has come to be one of my favorites, good sense of humor too.
* [Cognicast](http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast/) - Very regular and great topics, lots of good content in past episodes too!
* [Functional Geekery](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/) - Not always about Clojure but always functional.

### Videos

There are many videos available on [youtube - ClojureTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/ClojureTV) but these are a few that have really stood out for me:

* [Why Clojure? - Clojure/West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BThkk5zv0DE&t=7s) - A talk by [@derekslager](https://twitter.com/derekslager?lang=en) on why he chose Clojure for his company
* [Why Clojure? - Devoxx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLRSOyR47Ro) - Another talk on why clojure by [@vijaykiran](https://twitter.com/vijaykiran), I love hearing from people on this topic
* [Intro to Clojure - Stu Halloway NDC Conference](https://vimeo.com/68375202) - watched it about 20 times, this is when I finally understood the phrase "code is data". Recommend this for all new devs to watch at least twice! or 20!
* [String Calc Kata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_teKHH_Rk0) - a great intro to using tdd in Clojure.
* [Where's my Data? - Dave Chemlinsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3HDKNzZ5iw) - great insight into datomic, one of the videos that made me see the light.

### Resources

* [Clojure Cheatsheet](http://clojure.org/cheatsheet) - Very handy to keep open when you are coding, everything is hyperlinked for more info.
* [PurelyFunctional](http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/) - Great downloadable tutorials in Clojure and now has a subscription model with more content on a regular basis.
* [Datomic Training Online by Cognitect](http://www.datomic.com/training.html) - Watched a couple times to understand the concepts and now relational databases and SQL are ruined for me. `#datomic4life`

### Practice Practice Practice!

Koans are are a great start, but here are some other ways to practice. Learning is always better with a friend, find someone to learn with you.

* [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/) - Small problems you can solve and then see other's solutions. There is an [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bytopia.foreclojure&hl=en) for clojure on the go!
* [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/) - Simple problems you can solve in the editor, once you solve it you can see other's solutions.
* [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) - Similar to Codewars, has a series of problems you solve and wait for feedback from other users. Has alot of languages if you are a polyglot :) After you complete a problem you are invited to comment on other's solution.
