I’ve been programming since I was 13, when I found BASIC Programming book for my TRS-80. That was the end of playing outside in the summer for me. I spent hours painstakingly typing in source code from books and magazines. Sometimes when I was tired, my mom helped me by taking over the typing! My first projects were math games for my younger siblings and I distinctly remember making a dice rolling program for Yatzee. I usd ascii characters to build a box around a number representing a die and then you could choose which dice to re-roll.

I dabbled in C/C++ in highschool and installed linux when I was 16 on a dare from a friend who said "You can’t do it, it is too hard!". Fast-forward into college where I learned Pascal (my university was a little behind the times) and the last semester we studied java. Wow! Nice GUIs with buttons! I was so excited! I graduated with the high hopes of getting a java job. Problem was, I didn’t have the required (it seemed) three-years experience that every job posting required. I picked up a PHP book and made a website. I used that website to get my first job.

After 5 years of PHP I was looking for a new challenge.. and a new job. In 2005 I started learning ruby and perl. I remember when I first learned ActiveRecord - how excited I was! I had been trying to develop a similar library in php for months with little success. It was in Perl that my love for testing was born, learning [TAP](https://testanything.org/) and using test coverage tools had me in cloud nine. Though Perl's syntax was challenging at times (inside-out objects totally blew my mind) I liked to say "Perl is like a crossword puzzle, except I can solve it... Eventually."

My love for Ruby outpaced that of perl because of the community. Early on I registered rubygeek.com and when Github was announced, I registered that username. 

I've worked at various big (ie google) and small companies (ever heard of info.com?) since 2001. In 2013 I started my own consulting company doing long-term contracts and augmenting teams doing development and testing. Currently I have left the full-time consulting world and work as Engineer in Test II for [Condé Nast](http://www.condenast.com) helping to [Automate Manual Tests](https://technology.condenast.com/story/automated-testing-qa-brand-sites-robot-framework).

I like blogging because it reinforces what I am learning. Sometimes I find my own blog posts when doing google searches and realize DOH! I already knew that. I hope others can learn from my posts too.

Lately I have been learning [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) since functional programming makes awesome sense to me and I eagerly learn all I can on the subject.

I love programming and learning new things. I can't image doing anything else.
