## Tips

### Read the source
When using [apidock.com](http://www.apidock.com) click see source code to learn ruby from the rails source

### Read Tests
When trying to figure out how gems work, look at tests. If a gem doesn't have tests, go beat someone over the head then write some yourself. If you are having problems with a gem, look at the issues and see if yours is listed.

### Join a local user group
I've learned more from this then anything I think, I've gotten jobs and made lifelong friends. Look on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com)

### Create a study group
I've done this a few times, get a few friends together to meet online and work on a project or problems together.

### Practice, Practice, Practice
You can't get good at something if you don't [practice](http://blog.rubygeek.com/blog/categories/practice/).
