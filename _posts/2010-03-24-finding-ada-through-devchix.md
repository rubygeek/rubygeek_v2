For this years <a href="http://findingada.com">Finding Ada</a> post, I would like to highlight several members of DevChix and their contributions and inspirations to the group.

<a href="http://www.desimcadam.com/">Desi McAdam</a> - One of the co-founders of DevChix. She is always there to put some perspective on things and teach me about diplomacy. Sometimes I get frustrated and speak without thinking things though :)

<a href="http://geek.susanpotter.net">Susan Potter</a> - Very technical and has very good reasons for why and how she does things. Whenever I see her post on DevChix mailing list, I will pay close attention to what she says.

<a href="http://jenstander.com/">Jen Stander</a> - Another of the co-founders of DevChix, always a good friend to listen to me and helps me plan DevChix activities in Chicago.

<a href="http://www.ghendry.net/">Ginny Hendry</a>- Member of Chicago Ruby group, she has been instrumental in planning Hack Nights for the group and enthusiastic about learning!

<a href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/">Sarah Allen</a> - Inspired me to learn more about mobile development and I am amazed at the variety of things she is doing!

<a href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/">Sarah Mei</a> - Along with Sarah Allen, they both have inspired me to do something for women in Chicago. A one-day workshop or something, the Chicago DevChix have a meeting in a few weeks to plan this!

And I would like to thank all of <a href="http://www.devchix.com">DevChix</a>, veterans and newcomers alike! We are nearing 400 members and really I don't know how to explain how supportive and inspiring they are! 

/tear  You Ladies Rock!!!
