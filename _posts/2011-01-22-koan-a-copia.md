I first learned about Koans from EdgeCase Ruby Koans project, it was great fun and great practice. Since then, whenever I mentored a DevChix or RailsMentors member I suggest to start doing Koans... even on a regular basis, once you finish them all ... then start over! I always have a ruby koan mid-way and work on it when I want to practice ruby. Sometimes I try to complete the whole file then run it. Since I’ve been learning Groovy this week, I looked to see if there was Groovy Koans, found those.. then I just started compiling all the languages I know of..

Its has sample problems done in multiple languages. Kinda fun!! (I recognize some of them as interview questions)
