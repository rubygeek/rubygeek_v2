###Or how to dive into a large untested project and be productive

This is how I feel sometimes when I come upon a large untested project:

I've been talking to folks and pondering this question..how to be effective (in a new to me) large untested project?  I was listening to [RubyRogues](http://rubyrogues.com/067-rr-gary-bernhardts-testing-style/) and they mentioned this talk at Cascadia Ruby (I immedately recognize the name as one of the [devchix](http://www.devchix.com) and they praised her talk [Therapeutic Refactoring](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1071-cascadiaruby2012-therapeutic-refactoring). I've listened to it twice so far. Its kind of entertaining too!

[Evan Light](https://twitter.com/elight) mentioned this book [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://amzn.to/2qMgjm8) ... I think I flipped through that once in 2008, the java examples made my eyes glaze over, but I should give it another chance. He gave a talk at (Lone Star Ruby Conference)[http://lonestarrubyconf.com] and refactored a bit of code by breaking it into chunks. His (slides)[http://elight.github.com/fdd/]. He didn't cover tests, but it shows practical ways to get started.

Finally, some practical techniques for diving into a codebase and starting to write tests. I think I have enough tips to get started as I dive into some code this week.
