First of all, thanks to some howtos at http://wiki.ubuntu.com I was able to get my video drivers setup. Now I'm basking in 1680x1050 glory. I can have windows side by side -- almost... i usually shrink the window a bit. Very nice. People have asked me about my laptop, I got it from PowerNotebooks, this <a href="http://www.powernotebooks.com/specs/Sager/5720specs.php">model.</a>  At the recent group meetings I've been at, people go "Wow .. thats some laptop!". In fact on the train ride to the perl meeting, <a href="http://perlcast.com/">Josh McAdams</a> whips out his cute little 12 inch mac, <a href="http://www252.pair.com/comdog/">brian d foy</a> his mid sized mac.. and here I am with my honking thing! I said look: daddy bear, momma bear and baby bear! hehe.. it was funny.

Last friday night and saturday I was at the <a href="http://citconf.com/">Cit-Con</a> testing conference. It was great, they had a variety of topics and although some weren't really in my line of work I found them interesting. I got to talk to <a href="http://www.jrandolph.com/blog/">Jason Huggings</a>, author of <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> and <a href="http://petdance.com">Andy Lester</a>, owner of the perl package <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Epetdance/WWW-Mechanize-1.18/lib/WWW/Mechanize.pm">WWW::Mechanize</a>. They did a "Battle of the web testing packages" of some sort. Andy talked about Mech, and the advantages over Selenium...then Josh defended himself and talked about the pros of Selenium.

While I was there, Pete helped me with my laptop. I couldn't install Perl modules and I wasn't sure why. He looked at it and said I needed cc or gcc. So along with more help from Andy (I'm sure they were tired of me by end of day) I was able to get it installed..and off I go. I've installed Mechanize and tried it out, pretty nifty.

The following Tuesday, I went to the <a href="http://www.uniforum.chi.il.us/">UniForm Chicago SIG Perl Meeting</a> where  Josh McAdams gave an extremely interesting talk on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Ethaljef/Perl-Critic-0.15/lib/Perl/Critic.pm">Perl::Critic</a>, which  will check your code for standards suggested in the Perl Best Practices book (very good read, even for PHP programmers). Very handy, I'm sure I will be using it alot. We had some fun and ran it on brian d foy and Andy Lesters code. heehehe.. they did ok :)

Now that I've been able to install Perl modules, I've been playing around with Andy Lesters <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Epetdance/hwd-0.20/bin/hwd">How We Doin'</a> module. Kinda nice.. can't get GNU Plot thing to work, I'll keep trying :)
